## Assignment 2 : Pilot UT

#### Introduction

UT stands for User Testing, and it is a method of evaluating a product or service by directly observing and gathering feedback from its users. The purpose of UT is to identify any usability issues, design flaws, or other problems in order to improve the app from a user's perspective.
This particular UT is a pilot test in order to test the setting and materials (app and test survey with tasks). It takes place in the participant’s home via a portable minimalistic lab which usually consists of their laptop or smartphone device and a video calling app with screen share functionality (i.e. Zoom). To conduct a UT, the first step is to define the objectives and the goals of the test. These goals are aligned with the findings of the heuristic evaluation that can be found in assignment 1. The heuristic evaluation identified potential problems in the following heuristic sections:

-<i>Visibility of system status:</i> The pending tasks section is limited by not having clear sections on types of tasks.

-<i>Match between system and the real world:</i> people who are new to genealogy might still have trouble understanding the words used.

-<i>User control and freedom:</i> Users may accidentally delete or modify data in their family tree and not be able to recover it due to limitations in the app's undo and redo functionality.

-<i>Error prevention:</i> The app lacks error messages to alert users when their input contains inconsistent or contradictory information, which may be conflicting with other data in the family tree. This deficiency can potentially result in confusion for users who may not be able to identify the issue and fix it appropriately.

-<i>Recognition rather than recall:</i> The cluttered and complicated user interface that can be overwhelming to some users, making it harder for them to locate the desired information. Additionally, the app's color-coding scheme only distinguishes between the genders of family members, lacking a diverse range of colors to differentiate between generations or family connections. As a result, users may encounter difficulty identifying relationships between family members, particularly those from different generations, which can hinder the app's usefulness in tracking and documenting family history.
 
-<i>Flexibility and efficiency of use:</i> Some users may experience difficulty in using the advanced features, leading to frustration, such as when attempting to filter search results in the research section. Moreover, the app includes several features for gathering family tree data, which may not be immediately apparent or easy to understand for some users.

-<i>Aesthetic and minimalist design:</i>  Dark background might pose visibility challenges for certain users, and its color-coding feature only distinguishes between male and female relatives, potentially making it too simplistic to discern between family branches.

The process of UT involves the participant to follow along with the provided questionnaire which contains sections of background questions for previous experience with the app, pretest questions for the participants initial impressions of the app, three tasks with checklists to note if the participant could complete each part of each task, as well as post test questions to evaluate the participants sentiments towards each task and the app as a whole. By following along with the questionnaire, the participant helps measure the severity of the problems that the heuristic evaluation outlined and how we might be able to amend these issues. Specifically for this UT, the participant is able to outline what in the FamilySearch app was most confusing or difficult to use.

#### UT Reflection

Reflecting on this UT, I was able to learn many ways in which the organization of the app confused the participant and what about the app was very straightforward and user friendly. For example, my participant was able to add known information to their family tree with ease as there was a clear family tree section of the app that contained obvious addition signs along with color coding for paternal or maternal sides of each family branch. On the other hand, when it came to locating information that was not known off the top of their head for the family tree, it took much longer than expected for the participant to even find the function to search historical records. Once that was located, it was even more difficult for the participant to find associated records with their family. I was able to see that this was due to the issues in Recognition rather than recall, Flexibility and efficiency of use, as well as Error prevention. Firstly, the participant struggled to find the “search historical records” function as it was located in the “more” tab of the app which is quite cluttered and unclear as to which functions it contains for users. Then in searching for their relatives the participant struggled to identify and use the advanced features which would aid them in narrowing down the search results. Lastly, there was no sort of error notifications or prevention when the participant entered in wrong information into the family tree to better associate with record results. 

In the future, UT for this app may be improved by having the participant come better prepared with a bit more information on their family history. Given some time to find more accurate information on their grandparents may better measure the usability of the app's features. Additionally, since this particular project centers around facilitating family connection, it may prove worthwhile to conduct UT with two family members as participants that might help each other with the input of family information in order to measure usability issues in the future and evaluate how it might connect the two participants as they work together.
