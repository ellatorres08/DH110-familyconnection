## Assignment 3 : User Research

### Introductory Steps

### :white_check_mark: Step 1: Specify the Project Design Challenge

**What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?**
>This project will support users in being able to facilitate a stronger family connection by looking deeper into their genealogy. 
>Users will be able to construct their family trees and hopefully find relevant records and documents associated with their ancestors
> that could promote conversations with family members.

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
>This activity fulfills the user’s basic need for connection and understanding of one’s self and where they come from.

**What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
>Current solutions to satisfy this need involve heavy research whether it be reaching out to family members that are currently alive for information or seeking out records online or in libraries. 

**What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
>Certain limitations that would be improved with genealogy technology are not knowing where to look for your family records or not being able to remember names from your family tree that might be found automatically on a genealogy site.

### :white_check_mark: Step 2: Identify Target Users

**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**

>Demographic: People with basic knowledge of their immediate family members information who are curious to learn more about their ancestors and where they come from.

>Preferences: users have the ability to identify basic information about their family members and navigate an application on a smartphone.

>Expertise: users do not need any particular level of expertise to use this application.

**Where would the users perform the activity?**
>Activities using the FamilySearch app can be performed anywhere, however users may want to have access to contacting family members to help gather initial information for their family tree when first starting out. After user input information is gathered, the user can add family members and search through historical records anywhere and anytime.

**What would the users do to complete that activity?**
>To add family members to their tree, users simply need to press on the addition symbol where that specific ancestor would be. For example, to add your maternal grandmother, you would press the addition symbol above your mothers box on the tree where her mother is indicated. To search records on your ancestors, users simply navigate to the search section and input any information gathered on that ancestor to narrow down related documents. The app can also automatically find information as you enter in new family members to your tree.

### :white_check_mark: Step 3: Pick Research Method(s)

* The research method I employed was **participatory observation**.

* I conducted **participatory observation research** with a friend who fits my target demographic details by performing several activities to further explore their family tree and history.

### Here are some interesting quotes and insights from the interview:

**:one: The user reflects on the small amount of family records they could find. (Part 1 (18:11))**
> It (the lack of records) tells me that either there are not a lot of records that are saved, or this app doesn't have a large database. Again, they (User’s ancestors) all have pretty common names for the Dominican Republic. And I don't fully believe that the country keeps good records. of their things. So it's very possible that these records are just lost to time. Like that, there's maybe a copy somewhere else in like the possession of my grandparents.

**:two: The user's experience with the mapping feature of the familysearch app  (Part 2 (5:06))**
> I can see specifically where on the map the family that I have put in is located. Very cool. Well, I never knew that those two places were that far from each other where my mother is from and where my dad is from. It seems I can do this in generations.

**:three: The user notes their favorite part of activity three and the benefits/ shortcomings of the family history activities section of the FamilySearch app (Part 2 (15:02))**
> I think the where I'm from / the in home activities (Are their favorite features). Because I feel like the best way to learn about your heritage is always gonna be from the people who know it best who experienced it. And that's fun ways to share those things.
(Part 2 (17:25))
Like I think it (The family history activities section) was really cool. The culture tabs they had and the things on like society and stuff. But those were things I already knew. It's very surface level. It's like things you will experience in the culture. I guess it's good if you don't have like any exposure, I guess, to your culture. It could be a good start, but definitely not somewhere to finish looking.

**:four: The user reflects on the impact of their age on finding family history information (Part 2 (21:47))**
>That's such an interesting question. I don't think I think yes and no. Yes, it is a barrier because I don't know the information. I wasn't alive for it or I wasn't old enough for it to be in my circle of little kids stories. But no, in the sense that I can find things around the app very well that I can find the places to search for records and where these activities are fairly quickly. Because I am I've grown up with technology and I'm used to it by this point.

**:five: The user discusses their connection to the topic of family history (Part 2 (23:14))**
>I feel very connected to this topic. And I think it's a really interesting thing to research and look into However, having in an app, that tool like forming bases is to like, build your own little family tree and have all this information in one place. Although it seems nice it seems just kind of superficial. I feel like the best place you're always gonna get that kind of information is from source.

### Reflection

I thoroughly enjoyed the contextual inquiry process. I feel that the reflection questions paired along with the activities allowed the user to be very candid about each feature of the app and accurately contemplate its impact on the family tree building experience. Observing my interviewee’s reactions and prompting them to think about family connection through genealogy greatly helped reveal many of the positive aspects and limitations of the FamilySearch app. Since this project focuses on technology that facilitates family connection, the interview helped enlighten me on which features of the app really promote working together with your family members. The user even expressed excitement on sharing information and completing the offered family history activities with their relatives. On the other hand, my interviewee expressed some disappointment in other sections, such as the limitations when searching for records from family members with common names or ones that don’t come from the United States. Additionally, the information provided about their culture after building the family tree and adding location detail, was noted as very shallow. I can see how this technology could benefit someone outside of their culture and with little knowledge of their family history. However, the knowledge provided seemingly only scratches the surface for what my user hoped to find about their ancestors, their history and their country. In the future, my user research may be aided by interviewing a user with more family history in countries that the apps database has a larger volume of records in, as well as someone with ancestors who come from various backgrounds and countries, in order to diversify results and generated cultural information.
