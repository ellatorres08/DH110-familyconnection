### Introduction: About the Project

The project revolves around enhancing the user experience of genealogy technologies, with a strong emphasis on strengthening family connections. The motivation behind this endeavor stems from the recognition of the profound importance of family bonds and the desire to make the process of exploring one's ancestry more engaging and accessible. By developing a genealogy app that prioritizes user journey, our project aims to create a seamless and intuitive experience for individuals to delve into their family history. Through this app, users will be able to easily navigate their ancestral lineage, connect with relatives, and discover their unique heritage. The project's contribution lies in revolutionizing the way people engage with their family history, fostering a greater sense of identity and connection among individuals and their ancestors.

### Design Statement: 

The issue at hand is the need to improve the user experience of genealogy technologies, particularly in terms of strengthening family connections. It is crucial to address this issue through our project because family bonds hold significant value in people's lives, and exploring one's ancestry can provide a deeper understanding of oneself and a sense of belonging. By prioritizing user experience and creating a genealogy app that facilitates a seamless and intuitive journey, we aim to make the process of delving into family history more engaging and accessible. Our project seeks to empower individuals to connect with their relatives, navigate their ancestral lineage, and discover their unique heritage, thus fostering a stronger sense of identity and connection with their roots.


### Competitor analysis:


#### Heuristic evaluation
The first step of the project was to look at websites focused on the same subject as this project

#### Usability Testing

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on my potential competitors, I realized multiple principles were being violated and I decided to look further into the YMCA 360 website and see how my target audience reacts when using it to perform simple tasks. I started by a pilot Usability Test and focused on 3 main tasks: playing a workout video, finding the FAQ, and using the favoring video function. My goal with this experiment was to see if my usability test material was effective and in term, better understand the usability experience of target users and their pain points.

Here is the usability test:

This pilot usability testing aided me to better understand the point of view of my target audience as well as validate some of my previous assumptions I had made.
*  I saw that the participant had no issues with finding a workout video and playing it but she did struggle with ***finding the FAQ and the favorite video folder.*** 
* The participant did find the website overall ***easy to use and didn’t require technical support*** to make it work but thought it ***could be better integrated.***

From this competitor analysis, I realized **the importance of creating not only an efficient user experience to access the workout videos but also a great experience for other important functions of the website** such as finding the FAQ, login in, favoring a video etc. However, I was left wondering how my users would interact with the product during a typical workout.



### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment03]:
After conducting UT, I decide to expand 
I thoroughly enjoyed the contextual inquiry process. I feel that the reflection questions paired along with the activities allowed the user to be very candid about each feature of the app and accurately contemplate its impact on the family tree building experience. Observing my interviewee’s reactions and prompting them to think about family connection through genealogy greatly helped reveal many of the positive aspects and limitations of the FamilySearch app. Since this project focuses on technology that facilitates family connection, the interview helped enlighten me on which features of the app really promote working together with your family members. The user even expressed excitement on sharing information and completing the offered family history activities with their relatives. On the other hand, my interviewee expressed some disappointment in other sections, such as the limitations when searching for records from family members with common names or ones that don’t come from the United States. Additionally, the information provided about their culture after building the family tree and adding location detail, was noted as very shallow. I can see how this technology could benefit someone outside of their culture and with little knowledge of their family history. However, the knowledge provided seemingly only scratches the surface for what my user hoped to find about their ancestors, their history and their country. In the future, my user research may be aided by interviewing a user with more family history in countries that the apps database has a larger volume of records in, as well as someone with ancestors who come from various backgrounds and countries, in order to diversify results and generated cultural information.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment04]

UX storytelling emphasizes the importance of a user-centered experience by considering the underlying feelings and desires of users. It moves away from relying solely on heuristic principles and competitor analysis. By creating personas, such as Saige, a first-generation web developer, and Evelyn, a retired grandma, researchers gain insight into how the current system fails to meet their goals. Saige utilizes the app to strengthen family connections and learn more about their Haitian heritage, participating in family history activities and communicating with relatives overseas. Meanwhile, Evelyn uses the app to record her family history for future generations, connect with her grandchildren, and spend quality time with her family through various interactive activities. These personas highlight the specific needs and motivations of users, ensuring that the project caters to their experiences and desires.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]

<img src="https://github.com/ellatorres08/DH110-familyconnection/blob/main/assignment6/layout1.png" height="400px">

In order to develop a genealogy app that prioritizes a seamless and intuitive user journey, we utilize an interface design system to explore various app appearances and assess their impact on users. By evaluating different elements like shapes, layouts, colors, and typography, we aim to create an interface that resonates with users and meets their needs. Through the use of digitized wireframes, we analyze the family tree feature to identify the most effective visual and functional elements. This process allows us to refine the app's appearance, enhancing usability and enabling users to connect more effectively with their family history and heritage. User feedback indicates that the wireframe section was inviting and user-friendly, with a balance of professionalism and warmth. The inclusion of rounder shapes and the avoidance of childish fonts was particularly appreciated, as it maintained a family-friendly atmosphere without sacrificing professionalism. The standard rectangles were seen as uncomfortable and rigid, prompting their exclusion from the design options.

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment05)

<img src="https://github.com/ellatorres08/DH110-familyconnection/blob/main/assignment5/wireframe1.png" height="400px">

This low fidelity paper prototype serves as a valuable tool for early-stage design exploration, collaboration, and gathering feedback to address usability concerns and guide decision-making. It allows for efficient iteration on design concepts and ensures a cost-effective and user-centered development process. During user testing, it was observed that adding a back button to the search feature would enhance the user experience by enabling quicker navigation between connecting pages. Additionally, renaming the "family records" section to "personal records" and including a dropdown menu with all available options would alleviate confusion and provide a clearer overview of the app's features. These insights gained from testing will inform design improvements for a more effective and user-friendly final product.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment07)

A high fidelity prototype for the familytree app serves as a realistic and interactive representation of the final product, enabling designers, stakeholders, and users to experience its look, feel, and functionality in a tangible way. By validating design choices, collecting feedback, and identifying usability issues early on, the high fidelity prototype ensures a more refined and user-centered end product. In the process of creating this high fidelity prototype using Figma, components from the graphic design element variation are applied in order to lay out screens with consistent visual elements, and then interactions are added for a realistic user experience. Interactive elements are linked to different screens or actions, allowing users to navigate and interact with the prototype. Feedback from stakeholders and users gathered through sharing the prototype helps in refining the design before moving to development.
