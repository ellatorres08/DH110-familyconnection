### Introduction: About the Project

The project revolves around enhancing the user experience of genealogy technologies, with a strong emphasis on strengthening family connections. The motivation behind this endeavor stems from the recognition of the profound importance of family bonds and the desire to make the process of exploring one's ancestry more engaging and accessible. By developing a genealogy app that prioritizes user journey, our project aims to create a seamless and intuitive experience for individuals to delve into their family history. Through this app, users will be able to easily navigate their ancestral lineage, connect with relatives, and discover their unique heritage. The project's contribution lies in revolutionizing the way people engage with their family history, fostering a greater sense of identity and connection among individuals and their ancestors.

### Design Statement: 

The issue at hand is the need to improve the user experience of genealogy technologies, particularly in terms of strengthening family connections. It is crucial to address this issue through our project because family bonds hold significant value in people's lives, and exploring one's ancestry can provide a deeper understanding of oneself and a sense of belonging. By prioritizing user experience and creating a genealogy app that facilitates a seamless and intuitive journey, we aim to make the process of delving into family history more engaging and accessible. Our project seeks to empower individuals to connect with their relatives, navigate their ancestral lineage, and discover their unique heritage, thus fostering a stronger sense of identity and connection with their roots.


### Competitor analysis:


#### Heuristic evaluation
The first step of the project was to look at websites focused on the same subject as this project

#### Usability Testing

After conducting a heuristic evaluation on my potential competitors, I realized multiple principles were being violated and I decided to look further into the YMCA 360 website and see how my target audience reacts when using it to perform simple tasks. I started by a pilot Usability Test and focused on 3 main tasks: playing a workout video, finding the FAQ, and using the favoring video function. My goal with this experiment was to see if my usability test material was effective and in term, better understand the usability experience of target users and their pain points.

Here is the usability test:

This pilot usability testing aided me to better understand the point of view of my target audience as well as validate some of my previous assumptions I had made.
*  I saw that the participant had no issues with finding a workout video and playing it but she did struggle with ***finding the FAQ and the favorite video folder.*** 
* The participant did find the website overall ***easy to use and didn’t require technical support*** to make it work but thought it ***could be better integrated.***

From this competitor analysis, I realized **the importance of creating not only an efficient user experience to access the workout videos but also a great experience for other important functions of the website** such as finding the FAQ, login in, favoring a video etc. However, I was left wondering how my users would interact with the product during a typical workout.



### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment03]:
After conducting UT, I decide to expand 
I thoroughly enjoyed the contextual inquiry process. I feel that the reflection questions paired along with the activities allowed the user to be very candid about each feature of the app and accurately contemplate its impact on the family tree building experience. Observing my interviewee’s reactions and prompting them to think about family connection through genealogy greatly helped reveal many of the positive aspects and limitations of the FamilySearch app. Since this project focuses on technology that facilitates family connection, the interview helped enlighten me on which features of the app really promote working together with your family members. The user even expressed excitement on sharing information and completing the offered family history activities with their relatives. On the other hand, my interviewee expressed some disappointment in other sections, such as the limitations when searching for records from family members with common names or ones that don’t come from the United States. Additionally, the information provided about their culture after building the family tree and adding location detail, was noted as very shallow. I can see how this technology could benefit someone outside of their culture and with little knowledge of their family history. However, the knowledge provided seemingly only scratches the surface for what my user hoped to find about their ancestors, their history and their country. In the future, my user research may be aided by interviewing a user with more family history in countries that the apps database has a larger volume of records in, as well as someone with ancestors who come from various backgrounds and countries, in order to diversify results and generated cultural information.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment04]

Summary and link to your assignment folder
UX storytelling reminds the researchers and designers that the experience must be user-centered. By no longer thinking of websites through on heuristic principles and competitors analysis, UX storytelling allows researcher to reflect on the underlying feelings and desires that users may have when completing tasks and ensuring that those are being satisfied by the project. By creating personas, I will be able to think as the target users more generally and understand better how the current system in place does not meet their goals.

During my research, I created 2 personas: Saige and Evelyn

the development of a genealogy app that optimizes the user journey, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience. 

In order to determine the most effective interface for our target users, we employ an interface design system that delves into various app appearances and their potential impact. This systematic approach allows us to thoroughly examine the influence of different elements such as shapes, layouts, colors, and typography on the user's impression and usability of the app.

By exploring a range of design options on a digitized wireframe of the app's family tree feature, we aim to identify the visual and functional elements that resonate best with our users and align with their needs. This comprehensive evaluation of diverse interface possibilities enables us to refine and fine-tune the app's appearance, maximizing its usability and ultimately enhancing the users' ability to connect with their family history and heritage.

Overall, the user reported feeling very invited to play around with this section of the wireframe. They mentioned how user-friendly it all felt while still maintaing a good balance of professional and welcoming aspects as well. When showing them the other design options I had after conducting the impression test, they pointed out how the darumadrop font was too childish but the addition of the rounder shapes made it more family friendly without sacrificing professionalism. In fact, they even mentioned how the standard rectangles made the tree feel almost uncomfortable and much too rigid.

### Low-fidelity prototype (wireflow, assignment05)

Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)
a low fidelity paper prototype is tested to conduct early-stage design exploration, encourage collaboration and feedback, address usability concerns, and guide decision-making before advancing to more resource-intensive stages of development. This approach allows us to efficiently iterate on design concepts, gather valuable insights, and ensure a cost-effective and user-centered development process.

the wireframe was fairly straightforward to my user, but I did learn a few things that confused them as well as some things that could improve their user experience. When searching up family members/ records in the first task, they noted the potential usefulness of a back button in addition to the drop down menu button. Adding this to my design would allow users to go back and forth between connecting pages with higher efficiency. Then during the second task, they were able to find and complete the family history activity of mapping where in the world their family is located, but struggled to find the journal entry option in the family records section. Observing this, I would perhaps change the name of that section to “personal records” to clear up a bit of confusion on the purpose of that section. I would also add a subsection to that section on the menu with a drop down of the options so that the user can see all the available options on the app without having to go through each section/page.

### High-fidelity prototype (functional/interactive prototype, assignment08)
Summary statement and link to or an embedded prototype

a high fidelity prototype for an app is to provide a realistic and interactive representation of the final product before the development phase. It allows designers, stakeholders, and users to experience the app's look, feel, and functionality in a more tangible way. The high fidelity prototype helps validate design choices, gather feedback, and uncover usability issues early in the design process, resulting in a more refined and user-centered final product.

The process of creating a high fidelity prototype in Figma involves several key steps. Firstly, the designer imports design assets, such as icons, images, and UI components, into Figma. Using Figma's powerful design tools, they then lay out the app's screens, ensuring consistency in visual elements, typography, and spacing. Interactions and animations are added to simulate the app's behavior, creating a more engaging and realistic user experience. Interactive elements like buttons, menus, and forms are linked to different screens or actions, allowing users to navigate and interact with the prototype as they would with the actual app. Finally, the designer can share the high fidelity prototype with stakeholders and users for feedback, conducting user testing and gathering insights to refine and improve the design before moving to the development phase.
